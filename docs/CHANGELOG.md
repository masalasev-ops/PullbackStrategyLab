# CHANGELOG.md

Prior text of every clean edit to a spec document.

`CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.html`, `SCHEMA.md`, `BUILD_PLAN.md` and `RUNBOOK.md` are read to know the **current** state, so a removal there is a clean edit: the old text is deleted, the citation stays at the point of change, and what it said before is recorded here.

That makes this file the only pointer to what a spec used to say, so **the citation on each entry is load-bearing**. An entry that does not name the decision authorising the change is a hole in the record, not a formatting lapse.

`DECISIONS.md` and `PROGRESS.md` are records. They correct themselves in place, by moving an entry to "Previously decided" or by adding a dated correction, so they never appear here.

## Entry format

```
### <date> — <document> — cites <decision name>
Was:  <the exact prior text>
Now:  <the exact replacement, or "removed">
Why:  <one line, or the decision speaks for itself>
```

### Before the first commit

Every document here was written, reviewed and corrected several times before `git init`. Those changes are not recorded below, and the reason is worth stating rather than leaving to be inferred: a clean edit supersedes a **published** spec, and nothing was published until the first commit. Recording the drafting history of text no session ever read would fill this file with noise on day one.

The rule starts at the first commit. From that point every clean edit to a spec lands here with its prior text and the decision authorising it.

### 2026-08-25 — CLAUDE.md — cites Every fixture expectation records how it was produced, and only the independently derived ones verify anything
Was:  7. The checkpoint's expectations are added to the golden fixture, so `tools/verify-phase` covers it from now on. A checkpoint that adds behaviour and no expectation has widened the unexamined set.
Now:  7. The checkpoint's expectations are added to the golden fixture **with their tier**, so `tools/verify-phase` covers it from now on, and at least one of them is `DERIVED` or `CONFIRMED` rather than `FROZEN`. A checkpoint that adds behaviour and no expectation has widened the unexamined set; one that adds only frozen expectations has added regression detection and called it verification. Expectations are owed at the checkpoint that produces them, **or carried to the checkpoint that first can** where the fixture does not exist yet, and a carried obligation is recorded in `BUILD_PLAN.md` when it is created rather than remembered. (see: Every fixture expectation records how it was produced, and only the independently derived ones verify anything)
Why:  Done condition seven required an expectation and said nothing about how it was produced, so a checkpoint could satisfy it entirely with output copied from the engine it was meant to check. The carve-out is stated because the fixture does not exist until 1.7 and the condition is preceded by "All seven, or it is not done".

### 2026-08-25 — BUILD_PLAN.md — cites Every fixture expectation records how it was produced, and only the independently derived ones verify anything
Was:  | 1.6 | IndicatorEngine: EMA 9/21/50, ADR20, ATR14, median dollar volume | Values for three hand-picked tickers match an independent calculation to 4 decimal places |
Now:  | 1.6 | IndicatorEngine: EMA 9/21/50, ADR20, ATR14, median dollar volume | Values for three hand-picked tickers match an independent calculation to 4 decimal places. **The independent calculation and its source are recorded in PROGRESS**, and those values carry forward as the fixture's first `DERIVED` expectations at 1.7 rather than being checked once and discarded (see: Every fixture expectation records how it was produced, and only the independently derived ones verify anything) |
Why:  The hand-check at 1.6 is the strongest evidence phase 1 produces and nothing carried it forward, so it would have been performed once and discarded.

### 2026-08-25 — BUILD_PLAN.md — cites Every fixture expectation records how it was produced, and only the independently derived ones verify anything
Was:  | 1.7 | **Phase report harness** and the golden fixture: real bars for 30 tickers over 250 sessions, committed, with expected indicator values frozen beside them. `tools/verify-phase` runs the pipeline over the fixture, diffs against expectations, parses the architecture tables, located by heading text rather than by position, and asserts each claim against the code, then writes `artifacts/phase-report.html` and `.json` | **Openable, and machine-readable.** Report shows three sections: doc conformance, fixture diff, coverage. Every architecture claim is pass, fail, or **unexamined**, and unexamined is not a pass. From here on every checkpoint adds its expectations to the fixture (see: Every phase ends in a generated phase report, not in a page somebody looks at) |
Now:  | 1.7 | **Phase report harness** and the golden fixture: real bars for 30 tickers over 250 sessions, committed, with expected indicator values beside them, **each carrying its tier**. `tools/verify-phase` runs the pipeline over the fixture, diffs against expectations, parses the architecture tables, located by heading text rather than by position, and asserts each claim against the code, then writes `artifacts/phase-report.html` and `.json` | **Openable, and machine-readable.** Report shows three sections: doc conformance, fixture diff, coverage. Every architecture claim is pass, fail, or **unexamined**, and unexamined is not a pass. The fixture diff is broken down **by tier** rather than reported as one number, and the report states how many expectations changed since the last commit alongside how many passed. **1.7 back-fills expectations for 1.1 to 1.6 with their tiers**, discharging the obligation raised at 1.1, since those checkpoints predate the fixture and could not meet done condition seven when they landed. From here on every checkpoint adds its expectations to the fixture (see: Every phase ends in a generated phase report, not in a page somebody looks at) (see: Every fixture expectation records how it was produced, and only the independently derived ones verify anything) |
Why:  "Frozen beside them" named the weakest tier as though it were the only one, and the back-fill closes the obligation raised at 1.1 against a stated requirement rather than against someone's memory.

### 2026-08-25 — ARCHITECTURE.html — cites Headings carry no numbers, and anchors are slugs
Was:  The harness is described in 18.1 and is built at the seventh checkpoint of phase 1, before most of what it checks exists.
Now:  The harness is described under "The phase report" and is built at the seventh checkpoint of phase 1, before most of what it checks exists.
Why:  A section number left over from before headings became slugs. It resolved to nothing.

### 2026-08-25 — ARCHITECTURE.html — cites Every line of code runs unmodified on Windows and on Apple Silicon macOS
Was:  <tr><td>Filesystem case sensitivity</td><td>macOS is insensitive by default, Linux is not</td><td>Lowercase file and directory names throughout, enforced by a check. A mismatch that works on both your machines will fail the first time it touches a Linux CI runner</td></tr>
Now:  <tr><td>Filesystem case sensitivity</td><td>macOS is insensitive by default, Linux is not</td><td>Lowercase names for every path the application composes or reads at runtime: the data root and everything under it, the golden fixture, <code>artifacts/</code> and <code>tools/</code>. .NET source and project directories keep the framework's PascalCase, which the repository layout mandates. Enforced by the <code>path-casing</code> check, which asserts each path literal against the on-disk path byte for byte rather than asserting lowercase, since exact match is the stronger property. A mismatch that works on both your machines will fail the first time it touches a Linux CI runner</td></tr>
Why:  "Lowercase throughout" contradicted the repository layout in `CLAUDE.md`, which mandates `PullbackStrategyLab.Core` and its siblings in PascalCase, and it also misdescribed `path-casing`, which asserts exact match rather than lowercase. Taken literally the architecture forbade the layout the same corpus requires. Folded into the same edit: the two `<h3>` headings under "The two patterns" gained the `id` attributes every other heading in the document already had.
